# Coffeeoffers
A work-in-progress analytics project focused on optimizing a café’s customer rewards program by uncovering actionable insights through segmentation and behavioral analysis.

There are initially three (3) files - customers, events, and offers. The customers and offers have their unique ids. They are related into the events sheet. The event is essentially a 30-day period where varying offers are given to customers. The transactions are also collected over this 30-day period.

What I've uploaded, and will continually update, is my power pivot journey as I explore what this aspect of Excel can offer me.
